# Nemesis Skill Issue

Hades II mod to make Nemesis less bothersome when she appears in your runs.

## Features

- Makes Nemesis deal no damage during the killing contest so you always win.
- Makes Nemesis stand in place after her encounters so she never steals doors from you.
- Theoretically makes Nemesis teleport out of the encounter rather than stealing your doors. (This should only ever trigger if you somehow wait out massive delay.)
- Makes Nemesis infinitely wait around when she appears in the shop so she can't steal any items.
